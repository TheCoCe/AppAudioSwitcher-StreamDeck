## About

This StreamDeck plugin allows you to switch the output device for the currently focused app. Simply rotate the dial to select the device and click it to apply.
It uses the [AppAudioSwitcherUtility](https://github.com/TheCoCe/AppAudioSwitcherUtility) helper I wrote that actually handles the audio devices and process.

## Usage

- Install the plugin from the file in the Releases
- Add the Switch App Audio dial action
- Select the relevant audio devices you want to switch through
- Done
